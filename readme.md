 This code is to segment a single image using Combined morphological-
 spectral unsupervised image segmentation.  Use the testSeg.m top
 level file to test out the system.



INPUT IMAGE MUST HAVE DIMENSIONS OF A POWER OF 2 CURRENT (i.e. 128x128, 256x256)
ALSO number of regions are limited to under ~1000 due to memory restrictions
